EXPERIMENTS

====Data

Experiments are performed on 3 data sets:

1)
6 classes of 2D images from
https://dabi.temple.edu/external/shape/MPEG7/MPEG7dataset.zip
(20 images in each class)

we exchanged black and white to have black foreground
and we converted to text format (in order to process them with basic 
python without extra packages and conform to 3D format)

Inputs are in folder: FileMpeg

2)
1 2D image from each of the six classes, rescaled
to have side length = 500,1000,2000,4000 pixels

Input are in folder: FileScaledMpeg

3)
We considered six 3D shapes from the repository that was available
at  http://visionair.ge.imati.cnr.it/ (downloaded in 2022, the
address is no longer working).

Each shape (given as closed triangle mesh) was discretized into
a 3D image with side length = 64,128,256

Input are in folder: FileSolid

====Tests

Tests are described in files 
script_tests2D.txt  for 2D images (FileMpeg and FileScaledMpeg)
script_tests3D.txt  for 3D images (FileSolid)
